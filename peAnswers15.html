			<p class="text">Here's the final test, thank you to everyone who used the website. I will be back for summer PE 2, although I won't be doing anything after PE 2 because only 2 credits are required, and let's face it, anyone who cares enough to take more than the required amount probably wouldn't be using this website in the first place. See you guys next summer!</p>
