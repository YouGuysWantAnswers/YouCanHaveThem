			<p class="text">welcome to my website here is all the summer pe quiz answers</p>
			<p class="med">also some important things. The slides do not matter, at least i don't think. when you go back into it it resets everything so it probably isn't for a grade.</p><br>
			<p class="med">as of may 31st 2023 i don't have all the answers for summer pe, and im only on summer pe 1. so if anyone has the answers for the later classes dm them to me at reginald#8084. click the link(s) below for the summer pe answers.</p><br>
			<p class="med">all questions are banked so the questions are different each time. I believe i have all the questions but if i'm wrong, please dm any questions to me and i will add them to the list.</p><br>
			<p class="med">one last thing, if you ever mess up a quiz, go to the main page with the two links (the slides and the quiz). click the slides, immediately click the back arrow, then refresh the page and you will be able to retake the quiz 100% ALLOWED NOT CHEATING AT ALL.</p>
			<p class="med">ok have fun :)</p>
